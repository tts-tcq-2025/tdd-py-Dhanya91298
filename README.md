# TDD Driven StringCalculator

Build a StringCalculator functionality that can take up to two numbers, separated by commas, and will return their sum. 
for example “” or “1” or “1,2” as inputs.

> DO NOT jump into implementation! Read the example and the starting task below.

- For an empty string it will return 0
- Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers
- Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
  - the following input is ok: “1\n2,3” (will equal 6)
  - the following input is NOT ok: “1,\n” (not need to prove it - just clarifying)
- Support different delimiters : to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: “//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]” for example “//;\n1;2” should return three where the default delimiter is ‘;’ .
the first line is optional. all existing scenarios should still be supported
- Calling Method with a negative number will throw an exception “negatives not allowed” - and the negative that was passed. if there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message.
- Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001 = 2
- Delimiters can be of any length with the following format: “//[delimiter]\n” for example: “//[***]\n1***2***3” should return 6

## Tasks



Establish quality parameters:

- Ensure  maximum complexity (CCN) per function == 3

- Ensure 100% line and branch coverage at every step

  

Start Test-driven approach

1. Write the smallest possible failing test: give input `"" assert output to be 0 ` .
2. Write the minimum amount of code that'll make it pass.
3. Refactor any assumptions, continue to pass this test. Do not add any code without a corresponding test.


# Test specification
1. Empty string input returns 0
2. Single value input returns the same value itself
3. Return sum when 2 numbers are passed when separated by comma
4. Return sum when 2 numbers are passed when separated by newline
5. Return sum even when unknown number of inputs are passed separated by comma
6. Return sum even when unknown number of inputs are passed separated by newline
7. Return sum when single-character/multi-character custom delimiter is separating the numbers
8. Throw exceptions when negative number is parsed
9. Sum must be returned for all values less than 1000 only
